##Description
This project is a python implementation of the design pattern described in GoF.

###Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of relate or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.

###Builder
Seperate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction can create different representation.

###Factory Method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclass to decide which class to instantiate.Factory Method let a class defer instantiation to subclass.

###Prototype
Specify the kinds of object to create using a prototypical instance, and create new object by copying this prototype.

###Singleton
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point to access it.

###Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

###Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two way can vary independent.

###Decorator
Attach additional responsiblities to an object dynamically. Decorator provide a flexible alternative way to subclassing for extending functionality.

###Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

###Proxy
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

###Command
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log request, and support undoable operation.
