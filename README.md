##Description
This project is a python implementation of the design pattern described in GoF.

###Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of relate or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.

###Builder
Seperate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction can create different representation.

###Factory Method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclass to decide whichclass to instantiate.Factory Method let a class defer instantiation to subclass.

###Prototype
Specify the kinds of object to create using a prototypical instance, and create new object by copying this prototype.

###Singleton
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point to access it.
